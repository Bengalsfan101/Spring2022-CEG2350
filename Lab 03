1. PATH = is the list of directories that will be searched for anything that you type on the command line.
2. The files will go into the bin section and will be permited access to only execute for all users. 
3. Command: sudo mkdir /usr/java
   - Full path: file_exists = os.path.isfile(/etc/yate/input.txt)
                 if file_exists:
                  do_something

4. PATH = is the list of directories that will be searched for anything that you type on the command line.
   - Difference: The files that did exists, now show when searching through the command line. 
5. cp sorting-party /tmp/Lab03.md
6. The command that would allow all users to access would be 666. This gives permission to read, write, and execute. 
7. User, group, and others are allowed to access every file within the directory.
